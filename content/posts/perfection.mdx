***Perfection:***
*the state of being complete and correct in every way*

*I often feel as though I am in an endless pursuit of perfection.*

*The next goal. The next objective. The next milestone.*

*It lures me in with its promises of greatness.*

*Next time I will do it better. I will be more disciplined. More focused. I will achieve greater results.*

*When the time comes - perfection inevitably slips through my grasp.

*There is always something left on the table. Something to grasp. Some extra percentage I could have extracted from myself & my performance.*

*It feels as though I am chasing an uncatchable target.*

*I will feel content when this happens… after this event … this grade in my exam … this goal*

*But - when that time comes - it is accepted quickly, becomes the norm, & onto the next objective.*

*I can never reach the true state of perfection.*

*A state of being in which I am wholly fulfilled & happy with myself. Where everything fell into place just as I had intended. Where I could score myself 100/100.*

*Something was missing.*

*One must realise: perfection does not exist.*

*You cannot reach the unreachable. Catch the uncatchable.*

*We must focus in every moment on being the best one can be.

*That is enough.*

*Give everyday your all - & if you do not make it - do not reach the promised land of perfection - it is okay - you must be content.*

*Work hard. Give everything to life.*

*& accept what is given to you or the state you may be in.*
