*I often feel as though I am in an endless pursuit of perfection.*

*Chasing an uncatchable target.*

*The next goal. The next milestone. The next achievement will bring fulfilment.*

*It lures me in with its promises of serenity.*

*But - leaves a state of perpetual dissatisfaction in it’s path.*

*When the opportunity for perfection comes - it inevitably slips through my grasp.*

*There is always something left on the table. Something more to give. Some extra percentage I could have extracted from myself. If I was perfect.*

*Each time a new milestone is reached - despite how unachievable it once seemed - it is quickly accepted, becomes the norm, & the search for perfection continues.*

*I can never reach the state of true achievement. True perfection.*

*Where everything has finally fallen into place.*

*Something is missing.*

*Nothing is entirely complete.*

*It’s a trap.

*Perfection does not exist.*

*You cannot reach this unreachable place.*

*You cannot satisfy every desire. Meet each metric. Fufill every requirement.*

*You must focus in every moment on being the best you can be.*

*That is enough.*

*Give your all to everything, and if you do not make it, do not reach the promised land of perfection, it is okay, you must be content.*

*Opportunities will come.*

*Work hard. Give everything to life.*

*Accepting what is given to you.*

*Not everything will be correct. As you wish.*

*You must deal with the imperfections of life.*

*Having the privilege of existence is a close to the state of perfection as you can achieve.*
