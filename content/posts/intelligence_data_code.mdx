*It has been demonstrated with LLMs that scaling the amount of data leads to better performing models - while the underlying architecture remains the same.*

*The code that implements these architectures is relatively small & simple. For example, the 70B parameter Llama 2 model.py file contains only around ~500 lines of code, while requiring ~130 GB of memory to store the weights.*

*I wanted to reason about the **relationship between intelligence, data, & code.***

*This first requires a definition of intelligence.*

*One definition of intelligence could be: **one’s ability to understand the true nature of the universe.***

*This differs from typical definitions - which typically define intelligence as the ability to learn from experience, solve problems, & apply knowledge to manipulate one’s environment.*

*This reasoning comes from understanding what an ultimate intelligence may look like.*

*Imagine maximising intelligence towards infinity, such that a being has the ultimate possible intelligence. What would this being look like? I would suggest that this being would be **all knowing.** Therefore - it would understand the true nature of the universe & everything in it.*

*Thus, as intelligence increases, the ability to understand the nature of the universe increases. It is clear that humans understand more about their place in the universe than an ape. I suggest that a much more intelligent being than a human would understand much more about it’s place in the universe.*

*Given this definition - how can a relationship be found between **intelligence, data, & code.***

*Imagine a model that has been trained on a vast amount of data - & has a simple code implementation.*

*Data is a representation of the world. The more data that exists & the more refined this data is - the more clear the representation of the world is.*

*The data itself does not have any inherent intelligence. It is simply a lower-dimensional representation of the true world (i.e. 2D Text or 3D Images).*

*Likewise - the code itself does not have any inherent intelligence. It is simply defining a model architecture which can be used to encode data.*

*In this case - intelligence can be defined as the **encoding of the true world (represented by data) into the model architecture (represented by the code).***

*The better a model can encode the true world into the architecture - the more intelligence it has.*

*Encoding can be thought of as **understanding.***

*When humans understand something - we encode a simpler model of the true nature of that something into our minds - much like the model architectures.*

***As the amount of data increases - it provides a clearer representation of the true world for the model to learn from & therefore the model can encode a more sophisticated model of the world into it’s architecture, & ths has more intelligence. The code & model architecture remain the same - but the encoding of the data into the model defines the capabilities.***
