*As everyone else, I often think of what is my purpose in this life.*

*Here is the latest conclusion I have reached - the purpose I will define for myself for my 20s.*

***My purpose is to enable as many people as possible to have a long & fulfilling life.***

*How:* 

- *Working Intensely on Hard Challenges*

- *Learning Each Day*

- *Building Things that Enable Others to Reach Happiness & Fulfillment*

- *Spending Time with People I Love*

*There is no guide to a fulfilling life - but I should attempt to provide fulfillment for myself & as many other people as I can.*

*If there is any meaning I can define for the life - it is to have a life that is long & fulfilling - such that you can look back one day with a great feeling of happiness with how you spent your time & who you spent that time with.*

*If I can allow as many people to experience this is possible, for people close to me, & people I have never met - I think I will be able to find this happiness & fulfillment myself.*

*One day everyone & everything will be gone - so I should make my time count.*
