### Overview

Optimised Total Energy Utilisation of OoO Issue Processor Through Exploration of Microarchitectural Designs.

Utilised SimpleScalar & Wattch Simulators to analyse & optimise performance of a Splay Trees Benchmark.

Formulated & Executed a systematic strategy to identify the optimal microarchitectural configuration to achieve the minimum total energy (RUU Size, LSQ Size, Cache, etc.).
