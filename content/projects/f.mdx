### Overview

Designed a C Compiler that takes preprocessed ANSI-C as the source language & produces RISC-V assembly as the target language.

Lexer: C++ & Flex
Defines a list of Regular Expressions & Associated Actions which tokenise the source code and produce a stream of tokens.

Flex (Fast Lexical Analyser Generator): Open-Source Alternative to Lex
When a Flex input file is provided with Regular Expressions & Corresponding Actions - Flex generates a C++ program that performs tokenisation based on those rules.

Parser: C++ & Bison
Analyses the stream of tokens and formulates an Abstract Syntax Tree.

Bison - GNU Implementation of Yacc
Bison is a general-purpose parser generator that converts an annotated context-free grammar into a parser table.

Careful consideration was taken in how the program would create this AST - with a grammar being defined from which a shift-reduce Parser could be generated.

Code Generation:
Once the AST is generated - the nodes can be analysed to generate the corresponding RISC-V assembly
