### Overview

Designed an Autonomous Pathfinding Robot - to autonomously navigate, map, and calculate the shortest path through a maze.

### Navigation

To navigate the maze - the Robot used an DE10-Lite FPGA + Camera Module to perform real-time image processing. The feed from the Camera Module was passed to the FPGA board, which was programmed in SystemVerilog to perform image processing and act as a Vision System. The Vision System would use colour-detection to detect the white maze markings in the bottom half of the frame, and the coloured beacons surrounding the maze in the top half of the frame.

The Robot would then traverse the entirety of the maze - following the left wall, until it reach a point it had already traversed, at which point the server would communicate to command it to follow the right wall.

### Map

To Map the Maze - the Robot must be capable of determining the position in the maze - using a combination of dead-reckoning and vision.

IMU Orientation Values & Wheel Rotation Encodings could be fused into a Complementary Filter which produced an accurate determination of the position. This was used in combination with position detection by triangulating position from the coloured beacons. With a coloured beacon in each corner of the maze - the pixel width could be measured to determine it's distance, applying a triangulation algorithm to calibrate the dead-reckoning position periodically.

This position information could then be sent to the server - which could store the position values in a database structure - and send the values to a Host PC. The PC could then display the values on a user-interface, displaying to the user the layout of the maze.

### Shortest Path

The Shortest Path could then be determined using Dijkstra's Algorithm - placing a node at each intersection point of the maze - and determining the shortest path from start node to end node.
